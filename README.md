Comparative Analysis of NMT models for English to Manipuri translation
During zero-shot evaluation, NLLB-200 (facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M and facebook/nllb-200-distilled-1.3B ) successfully generated Manipuri in the Bengali script. However, for the Meetei Mayek script, the model suffered from the Copying Anomaly, outputting the source English text. In contrast, the Commercial Baseline (Google Translate) successfully generated Meetei Mayek.
